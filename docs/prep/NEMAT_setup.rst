2. Prepare a directory for a NEMAT run: ``nemat start``
=======================================================

Create a new **empty** directory and, inside the directory, use:

``nemat start``

This will copy into your directory the following elements:

1. A folder named ``membrane``
2. A folder named ``proteins``
3. A folder named ``mdppath``
4. A folder named ``ligands``
5. A folder named ``logs``
6. A file named ``input.yaml``

Now you have the structure to start a NEMAT run. You need to fill the ``input.yaml`` file with the parameters for your run (see :ref:`here <setup_input>`).
